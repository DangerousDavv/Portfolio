            As a recent Computer Science graduate with a passion for web
            development, I bring a strong foundation in programming and hands-on
            experience with modern technologies. Proficient in React,
            TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, I excel at creating dynamic,
            responsive user interfaces. My expertise extends to using Vite for
            fast development builds, Axios for efficient data fetching, and
            Redux Toolkit and React Query for robust state management.
            Additionally, I have experience with Node.js, Shadcn UI, Clerk,
            Supabase, Prisma, and Stripe.
